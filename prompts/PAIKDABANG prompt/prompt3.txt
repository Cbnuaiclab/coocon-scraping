1. Locate the comment marker // __DATA_EXTRACTION__ in the __WEBSITE_NAME__.js file
2. Use the data_extraction_template.txt file as the pattern for your implementation
3. From the HTML content to extract the following information from list of card:
   - Coffee name

Your implementation should follow the extraction pattern shown in data_extraction_template.txt while adapting it to handle the specific structure of the HTML. The extracted data should be clean, consistent, and properly structured for further processing.
