Use browser_action to launch a browser at the login page https://paikdabang.com.

Scroll down a bit and Click on the "FRESH COFFEE" image. 
Then use Firecrawl mcp tool to scrape the all the menu information from with the actual html structure, **exclude footer and navbar, only with main content as the context**.

Network Analysis:
Use the announcement URL to extract the data and analyze all network requests, parameters, and form-data structures to understand the site's communication patterns.

Then write the business logic implementation for the // __Business_Logic__ section, do not engage the // __DATA_EXTRACTION__  section in the newly created __WEBSITE_NAME__.js file:

1. Locate the comment marker // __Business_Logic__ in the __WEBSITE_NAME__.js file
2. Replace this marker with a complete implementation that follows the workflow_template.txt pattern. Use iSASTypes.js to handle error exceptions.

IMPORTANT: When implementing the business logic, determine whether login is required for the website:

- If login IS required:
  * Follow the "SCENARIO 1: IF LOGIN IS NEEDED" section in workflow_template.txt
  * Implement Steps 1-3 for login process, then proceed with data retrieval

- If login is NOT required:
  * Follow the "SCENARIO 2: IF LOGIN IS NOT NEEDED" section in workflow_template.txt
  * Skip Steps 1-3 and directly access the target page
  * Still maintain proper status updates using system.setStatus()
  * Handle errors appropriately using this.setError()

The implementation should be robust, handling both successful and error scenarios appropriately. Always check the network requests captured during browser analysis to understand the exact parameters and endpoints needed.
