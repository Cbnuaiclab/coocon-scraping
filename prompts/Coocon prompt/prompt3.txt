Implement the data extraction and cleaning functionality for the // __DATA_EXTRACTION__ section in the __WEBSITE_NAME__.js file:

1. Locate the comment marker // __DATA_EXTRACTION__ in the __WEBSITE_NAME__.js file
2. Use the data_extraction_template.txt file as the pattern for your implementation
3. From the HTML content to extract the following information from list of card:
   - title
   - description 

Your implementation should follow the extraction pattern shown in data_extraction_template.txt while adapting it to handle the specific structure of the HTML in html.txt. The extracted data should be clean, consistent, and properly structured for further processing.

When perform data extraction don't use regex pattern, prefer to use 
var titleSection = StrGrab(item, 'class="t-subject"', '</td>');
var title = StrGrab(titleSection, '">', '</a>').trim(); 
rather than 
// var titleSection = StrGrab(item, 'class="t-subject"', '</td>');
// var title = StrGrab(titleSection, '<a[^>]*>', '</a>').trim();
