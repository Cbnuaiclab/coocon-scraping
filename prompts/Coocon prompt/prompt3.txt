Implement the data extraction and cleaning functionality for the // __DATA_EXTRACTION__ section in the __WEBSITE_NAME__.js file:

1. Locate the comment marker // __DATA_EXTRACTION__ in the __WEBSITE_NAME__.js file
2. Use the data_extraction_template.txt file as the pattern for your implementation
3. Parse the HTML content from html.txt to extract the following information from list of card:
   - title
   - description 

Your implementation should follow the extraction pattern shown in data_extraction_template.txt while adapting it to handle the specific structure of the HTML in html.txt. The extracted data should be clean, consistent, and properly structured for further processing.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR BUSINESS LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION:
When implementing the business logic section, consider whether login is required:

1. If login is required:
   - Follow Steps 1-3 in the workflow_template.txt for login process
   - Then proceed with Steps 4+ for data retrieval

2. If login is NOT required:
   - Skip Steps 1-3 in the workflow_template.txt
   - Directly access the target page using httpRequest.get()
   - Process the results and perform any additional navigation or form submissions as needed
   - Always maintain proper status updates using system.setStatus()
   - Handle errors appropriately using this.setError()

The workflow_template.txt has been updated with examples for both scenarios. Use the appropriate section based on whether login is required for the specific website.
