Implement the data extraction and cleaning functionality for the // __DATA_EXTRACTION__ section in the __WEBSITE_NAME__.js file:

1. Locate the comment marker // __DATA_EXTRACTION__ in the __WEBSITE_NAME__.js file
2. Use the data_extraction_template.txt file as the pattern for your implementation
3. Parse the HTML content from html.txt to extract the following information:
   - 순서
   - 제목
   - 작성자
   - 작성일
   - 조회수
Your implementation should follow the extraction pattern shown in data_extraction_template.txt while adapting it to handle the specific structure of the HTML in html.txt. The extracted data should be clean, consistent, and properly structured for further processing.
